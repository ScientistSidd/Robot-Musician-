Research and Development of Robot Musician 

# Robot Musicianü§ñ 

## Need Statement:

It has been observed in the last few days that there is scarcity of people around the campus who can actually produce catchy tunes for the cultural events which are occasionally held at KLETECH. Also since we have humongous and phenomenal technology all over the campus , why not play with technology to reach the intersection of entertainment , music , technology and Artificial Intelligence. Thus Its need of the hour  to fuse all these , eventually innovating to develop a smart robot musician.

## Intro:
Robots are artificially intelligent machines that are meant to replicate the human brain. It‚Äôs 2019 and humans are not nomads anymore unlike the 1800 B.C , everyone is up to work and daily chores 24x7 , thus enabling the need for robots. Moreover people are becoming more inclined towards obtaining entertainment from technology. As we look forward and realize this , it is when Robotic Musician comes into play. Robot Musician is a machine that is designed in order to have these artificially intelligent music artists who can play whatever music the user wants to hear. It's not just normal music but these robots are specially designed to play instruments. They can be of several kinds , just like a great orchestra has musicians playing different instruments, same stays true in the world of robots too. Its upto the creator what instrument he wants the robot to play , from guitar to banjo , these smart creatures can play a lot of different instruments. They are usually based upon micro-controllers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.Just like humans , robots come in every shape and size. Robot Musicians can be portable as well as non-mobile and are capable of playing miniature toy instruments and real life big instruments as well.  

### Benifits of Robot Musician ü§ñ üéµ üéπ üé∏ :

1. It reveals the bright and entertaining side of technology.
1. It can be precise, efficient and supports multitasking.
1. It can be used by people of almost any age group , from teenagers to adults.
1. It can have custom tunes which user can select according to preference and play instrument for the same.

1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdEAco2JqkQ A Shimon is a four-armed robot marimba player built at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He uses machine-learning programs, trained on music theory and a wide range of musical styles, to improvise melodies, sometimes playing chord structures that would be physically impossible for humans to hit.

With the help of several alternating frequencies and thus producing alternate moments with different delays , we hear a catchy music tune.

6.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5OTpJgFdHI About this project: Automatic Servo controlled Xylophone 

 ![Xylophone using Arduino and Servos](https://cdn3.imggmi.com/uploads/2019/2/6/0f743675d223e43e917f1cb5e7045e36-full.png)

7.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtzvykU1vIg About this project : The device is a robot that can play a fully automated acustic guitar. The commands are transmitted by an android smartphone,that by the means of a terminal Bluetooth send the code to Arduino, this code corresponds to the song to perform. Arduino decodes the received code and processes the program corresponding to one of the tasks stored in memory, providing the actuators (motor steppers and servomotors) the necessary instructions for the correct function of the robot. The guitar is placed horizontally on a smooth and regular surface where all the handcrafted supports are to support the various actuators.

 
8.https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Robotic-Drum/ This project uses linear actuators (car door lock motors to be exact), and Arduinos with motor controller shields simply for ease of use and duplication.It is 100% automated and has the capability to produce relevant custom music. 

9.https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Flute-Player-Machine/ About this project : 
A project that combines art with engineering. 
A machine that plays the flute. It controls notes using Arduino. Various tune or song can be programmed on Arduino, which Arduino plays on flute. There is no limit to use the Arduino controls that plays the flute. I tried the following ways to use it to play music üéµ 

![Smart Automatic Flute using Arduino&Servos](https://i.ibb.co/jbnTjph/Screen-Shot-2019-02-07-at-3-26-05-AM.png)

Simply coding the song and playing it,
Playing tones using a Random function. 
A specific scale and rules can be defined on Arduino, such that it can compose (in realtime) and play a beautiful melody.
A microphone can be attached to Arduino. So you have to sing in the microphone, Arduino detects the frequency and plays the flute such that it follows whatever note you sing.


## Existing Solutions üíØ

![Shimon The Robot [2]](https://www.purdue.edu/convocations/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Shimon2_384.jpg)

1. Shimon, the robotic marimba player, can listen to, understand, collaborate with, and surprise his human counterparts. Along with a few other robotic musicians and musical cyborgs developed by Georgia Tech‚Äôs Robotic Musicianship group, Shimon uses artificial intelligence and creativity algorithms to push musical experiences and outcomes to uncharted domains.

### **Working Principle**

## Arduino Uno 

Arduino is one of the most widely used microcontroller chips and kits. Arduino boards have sets of digital and analogue input and output pins. These microcontrollers can be programmed for several purposes.

![Arduino chip](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Arduino_Uno_-_R3.jpg)

                      Arduino Uno SMD R3

##  Proximity Sensor 

Proximity sensor emits an electromagnetic field and detects any disturbance in the field to check for obstacles nearby. The maximum distance that this sensor can detect is defined "nominal range". Some sensors have adjustments of the nominal range or means to report a graduated detection distance. It can help us create music tone by sensing the moment of a physical object. [39]

##  Servo motor 

A servo motor is a device which can push or rotate an object. If you want to target at some specific angles or distance, 
then you use servo motor in missile launcher.this motor is run through servo mechanism. We can get a very high torque servo motor in a small and light weight packages.[41]
Due to these functions of motors, they are being used in many applications like toy car, RC helicopters and planes, Robotics, Machine etc.

##  DC motor 

A DC motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
It is of vital importance for the industry today and is also important for engineers to look into the working principle of DC motor.It runs on direct current power. It works on the principle of electromagnetism.
It consists of a current carrying coil which rotates under the influence of an electromagnetic field.[43]
